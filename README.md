# Android_NSP_USB_Installer
Install .nsp file to switch by using android smart phone.  
First you should know:If you have a smart phone with Android P,this app won't work.  
My smart phone is OnePlus 3T,I'm not sure it will work well on other smart phone.  
 
usage:  
  0.Make sure your smart phone support OTG,and I just test this with tinfoil in Kosmos v11.0.1.  
  1.Create a folder called 'nsp' in extended storage root path（the same directory with android,download,DCIM and other system folders） and then put your nsp files in it.  
  2.Open your tinfoil in switch and then set it to usb-install mode.  
  3.Link your smart phone with switch by any thing you have like a c-to-c line,then you may see a dialog windows on phone's screen,asking if you want to open this app,press yes.  
  4.Press the send button in app and then choose nsp files you want to install on your switch screen.
